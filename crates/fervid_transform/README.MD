# fervid_transform

Part of the `fervid` project, an all-in-one Vue compiler.
This crate is responsible for the transformations in the template, such as optimizing the AST or transforming the JS/TS expressions in the AST nodes.

In the future this crate may accommodate the `<style>` and `<script>` transformations, which are currently in their own crates.
